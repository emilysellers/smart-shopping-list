## Overview

## What is this project?

This project was developed over an eight-week period in 2023 by [Team 57](https://the-collab-lab.codes/developers/) of [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/). Our goal was to collaboratively create a “smart” shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you’re likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

This repo was forked from [Team 57's repo](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-57-smart-shopping-list). A huge part of our collaboration was achieved through pair programming, Github user stories, pull requests and code review - check it all out over here: [pull requests](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-57-smart-shopping-list/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/the-collab-lab/projects/92).

### How does it work?

As a user, you can create a new list or join an existing list with a three-word token. Then, you can enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) to your list. Each time you buy the item at the store, you mark it as "purchased" in your list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.
