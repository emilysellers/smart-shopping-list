## Overview

## What is this project?

This project was developed over an eight-week period in 2023 by [Team 57](https://the-collab-lab.codes/developers/) of [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/). Its goal was to collaboratively create a “smart” shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you’re likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

### How does it work?

As a user, you enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.
